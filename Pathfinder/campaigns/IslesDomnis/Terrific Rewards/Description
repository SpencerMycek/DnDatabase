Based around the legendary Tarrasque, a town has grown wealthy because of its \
(not-so) well kept secret: It has incapacitated and imprisoned the Tarrasque, \
and the town has been harvesting things from the ever-regenerating body of \
the tarrasque. Infinite wealth, strong weapons, stronger armor have been made \
readily available to the town of Raskend. Governed by the near-god, her \
lordship Mia Derrith, the Town of Raskend has quietly prospered in the \
Oneisian Empire, but not all believe the Prophetic words of her lordship \
Derrith, and not all believe the Tarrasque should be imprisoned.\

beginning-words="""
You find yourselves in the Oneisian Empire. A great feat of \
civilization in the larger Isles of Domnis. You need not know much about the \
Isles of Domnis, save that the Oneisian Empire is the largest and oldest \
empire.\n\
You have heard rumors of a magnificent city deep in the windy steppes of the\
continent, nestled between the twisting canyons and deep ravines of the torn \
and ripped country-side. A city called Raskend.\n\
The rumors have were not specific as to why this city has so much wealth to \
give, but on the wings of the words: "Infinite wealth, incredible power" \
etc. when a traveling caravan passes through assorted towns on its way to \
Raskend, you have decided to go along with this caravan and find yourself \
nearing this city.\n\
A note to the players: you have been traveling with this caravan for a while \
and so you have had some time to get to know some of the others you have been \
traveling with. Whether you have been friendly and gotten to know more about \
your fellow travelers is up to you.
